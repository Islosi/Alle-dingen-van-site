<BR><B>Hit Points at Higher Levels</B>: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st<P>

<LI STYLE="background-color:#ffffb3;width:750"><B>Starting Proficiencies</B>

<BR><br>
(a) a martial wepaon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
<br>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
<br>(a) a Priest's Pack or (b) an Explorer's Pack
<BRChain Mail and a holy symbol
<br><br>
Alternatively, you may start with<BR>
 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your own Equipment.<P>

<LI STYLE="background-color:#ffffb3;width:1000"><B>Divine Sense</B>
<BR>The presence of strong evil registers on 
your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful 
good rings like heavenly music in your ears. 
As an action, you can open your awareness to 
detect such forces. Until the end of your next 
turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, 
or Undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind 
total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, 
or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, 
but not its identity (the Vampire Count Strahd von 
Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, 
you also detect the presence of any place or object 
that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the 
Hallow spell.
<BR><BR>
You can use this feature a number of times equal 
to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a 
Long Rest, you regain all expended uses.<P>

<LI STYLE="background-color:#ffffb3"><B>Spellcasting</B>
<BR>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on Divine Magic through meditation and prayer to cast Spells as a Cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
<BR><BR><B>Preparing and Casting Spells</b>
<br><BR>
The Paladin table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells. To cast one of your paladin Spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.
<BR><BR>
You prepare the list of paladin Spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin Spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.
<BR><BR>
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared Spells can include four Spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared Spells.
<BR><BR>
You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of paladin Spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.
<BR><BR>
<B>Spellcasting Ability</b>
<BR><BR>
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin Spells, since their power derives from the Strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when Setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.
<BR><BR>
<B>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
<BR><B>Spell Attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
<BR><BR>
<B>Spellcasting Focus</B>
<BR><BR>
You can use a holy Symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin Spells.
<P>

<LI STYLE="background-color:#ffffb3;width:1000"><B>Lay on Hands</B>
<BR>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of Healing power that replenishes when you take a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
<BR><BR>
 As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
<BR><BR>
 Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of Healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple Diseases and neutralize multiple Poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
<BR><BR>
This feature has no effect on Undead and constructs.<P>

<LI STYLE="background-color:#ffffb3"><B>Sacred Oath</B>
<BR>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath Spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
