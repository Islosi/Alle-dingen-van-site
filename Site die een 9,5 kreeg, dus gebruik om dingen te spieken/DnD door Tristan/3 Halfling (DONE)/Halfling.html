<LI STYLE="background-color:#c5cea7;width:605"><B>SMALL AND PRACTICAL</B>
<BR>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear re1atively
harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing
between 40 and 45 pounds.
Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy
cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown
and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men
often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among
them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear
simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring
bright colors.
Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing.
They're concerned with basic needs and simple
pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the
wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a
cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have
a knack for finding the most straightforward solution
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.

Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.
