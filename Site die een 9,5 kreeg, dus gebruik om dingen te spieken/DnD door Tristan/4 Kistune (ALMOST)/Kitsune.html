<LI STYLE="background-color:#ccffcc;width:605"><B>TALL AND FURRY</B>
<BR>
Kitsunes live in their remote villages
where most people wouldn't even care to look.
Kitsune are generally quite tall, Ranging from 6 to 7 feet tall.
But they weigh almost the same as most humans.
Kitsune have 4 main subraces: Red, Grey, Dessert and Arctic.
These subrace can have children with eachother making crossbreeds.
Crossbreeds are common in most villages but some villages 
only allow pure breeds to live in it.
Crossbreeds can be anything from a patch of grey in dessert fur to being a perfect split between red and arctic fur.
Some Kitsunes also dye their fur in order to express themselves more.
the colors can be anything from a realistic grey to absurd colors like lime green or intense yellow.
A few important ranks of a village could also be spotted easier this way, for example
Elders usually paint their fur a light grey with tiger-like purple stripes.
Tails are a sign of a Kitsune's magic.
A Kitsune usually has one tail but, depending on their connection to magic, a Kitsune can have up to nine tails.
The number of tails is not a fixed number. 
A Kitsune can gain tails by strengthening their connection to magic, the same way 
the sagging of one's connection to magic can result in loss of tails.
The amount of tails usually establish the ranks of a village.
One tail is most of the time a sign for the common people, while 7 tails are usually the councillors and 8 to 9 tails are the Elders.
