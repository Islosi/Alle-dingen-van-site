<BR>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as
skilled warriors, miners, and workers
of stone and metal. Though they stand
well under 5 feel tall, dwarves are so
broad and compact that they can weigh
as much as a human standing nearly two
feet taller. Their courage and endurance
are also easily a match for any of
the larger folk.
Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
hue linged with red, but the most common shades are
light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually
black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have
red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and
groom them carefully.
